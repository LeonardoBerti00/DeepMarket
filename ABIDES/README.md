# ABIDES: Agent-Based Interactive Discrete Event Simulation environment

> ABIDES is an Agent-Based Interactive Discrete Event Simulation environment. It was developed by David Byrd, Mahmoud Mahfouz, Danial Dervovic, Maria Hybinette and Tucker Hybinette Balch.
> We only extended it to perform market simulations with our world agent represented by the diffusion model. So we added the file WorldAgent.py in DIR agent DIR, and the file world_agent_sim.py in the config DIR.
