1. Diffusion models
    1.1. fix CSDI @bardh
2. function to do the quantitative evaluation and plot the metrics: (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf)
    2.1. predictive score @marco
    2.2. discriminative score @marco
3. function to plot the results and do the qualitative evaluation as in the coletta paper, you can find the plot to do in overleaf @marco
4. hyperparameters search
5. constraint the generated execution events to assure that the match is done with a real order in the order book, so the price is the same as the one in the order book
6. Integrate ABIDES to do a full trading financial simulation as in the coletta paper
7. train with one stock and check the performance with another one
8. experiment with latent representation of market state, so the input conditioning, using a VQ-VAE or RQ-VAE
9. Implementing StockGAN (coletta) and maybe TimeGAN
10. Speed-up tricks @leo

(qui mettere solo major to do mentre per minor usare il classico to do)
