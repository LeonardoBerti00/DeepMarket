1. Diffusion models, everyone can implement one or two ideas and we can compare them
2. function to do the quantitative evaluation and plot the metrics:
    2.1. predictive score
    2.2. discriminative score
    2.3. js_shannon
    2.4. kolmogorov smirnov
3. function to plot the results and do the qualitative evaluation as in the coletta paper, you can find the plot to do in overleaf, maybe I can ask Matteo if the code is public
4. hyperparameters search (also with a window size T different from 1, so it means to generate T events instead of 1 at a time)
5. train and test with TSLA and INTC
6. Integrate ABIDES to do a full trading financial simulation as in the coletta paper
7. train with one stock and check the performance with another one
8. experiment with latent representation of market state, so the input conditioning, using a VQ-VAE or RQ-VAE
9. experiment with a latent diffusion model, so doing all in a latent space
   1.  This has been proven to not work in videos. See Flaborea et al. Multimodal Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model for Skeleton-based Video Anomaly Detection - Appendix. Maybe we can try, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
10. experiment with Spatial-temporal Representation in mid-price-centred Moving Windows (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05479.pdf)
